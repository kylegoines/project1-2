			 <h3>Health<br>Knowledge</h3>
			 <p>As one of the nation's most productive research institutes, Kaiser Permanente's research scientists are transforming the future of health care. Creating that knowledge, translating it into clinical practice, and sharing it with the world at large constitutes one of the key ways we acknowledge our responsibility to our communities while improving the quality of care and service we provide to our members. </p>

Whether in our facilities or through our partners within the safety net, more than 1 million people were able to access high-quality care and coverage. </p>

		 	  <p>Eight years ago, Kaiser Permanente established an annual day of service on Martin Luther King, Jr. Day to honor and recognize Dr. King and his advancement of civil and human rights. This has enabled thousands of Kaiser Permanente employees and physicians to provide valuable services to their communities and to further advance the Kaiser Permanente legacy that parallels Dr. Kingâ€™s values.</p>

				  <p>The David Lawrence Community Service Awards are named in honor of Dr. David Lawrence, former CEO of Kaiser Permanente and lifelong advocate and champion of improving community health. Every year hundreds of volunteers are nominated by their peers. In 2012, they met to share learnings and discuss future opportunities to make an even greater impact in the communities we serve. The awards recognize individuals and groups across the Kaiser Permanente regions who champion outstanding community service.</p>
