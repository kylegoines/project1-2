                 <p>We partner with public and private organizations to work toward the elimination of disparities in health and health care by providing access to care for all. We do this by removing financial barriers to care through our charitable care and coverage programs, medical financial assistance for members and non-members who do not qualify for other programs. We also provide support to community health centers, public hospitals, local health departments and school health centers to help deliver care for our most vulnerable populations.</p>

                 <p>Medical Financial Assistance helps people who have exhausted all means of private or public health care coverage. We want to ensure that everyone has access to the same quality care we provide for our members. For a growing number of Americans struggling to pay out-of-pocket medical expenses, this unique Kaiser Permanente program is a vital resource. We don’t want financial barriers to prevent individuals and communities from receiving quality care.</p>

				     <p>The health of communities is a matter of social justice that affects everyone’s health and quality of life. That is why year after year, we continue to make
                         the elimination of health disparities a top priority. We have decreased the gap between blacks/African-Americans and whites for controlling high blood pressure by 37 percent. We also are closing the gap in the rate of colorectal cancer screening between Hispanic and white members. We are
                         making significant strides on these and many other objectives related to health equity.
